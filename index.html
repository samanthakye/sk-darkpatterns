      <h2>Example 1: Duolingo and Confirmshaming</h2>
      <p><strong>Type:</strong> Dark Pattern</p>
      <p><strong>Who benefits:</strong> The platform: higher user engagement and activity, more long-term users and chances of users joining Duolingo Plus which is a subscription.</p>
      <p><strong>Description:</strong> Guilt-tripping or embarrassing users into continuing their learning streaks/activity on the app. For example, using images of Duo looking really sad because my streak is at 0 or being really excited that I opened the app after months of not using it. I think they use this type of guilt tripping to tug at my heart so that I can restart my streak.</p>
      <p>Here are some examples from my own Duolingo app:</p>

      <h2>Example 2: Equinox is a Roach Motel!!!</h2>
      <p><strong>Type:</strong> Dark Pattern</p>
      <p><strong>Who benefits:</strong> The company: it becomes a hassle to cancel the membership</p>
      <p><strong>Description:</strong> ("Roaches check in but they don't check out") Traps users by making the sign-up process super easy but cancellation policies super strict.</p>
      <p>My roommate had an Equinox membership for under a year and the only way for her to cancel her membership was to Photoshop her visa document...
        Other methods of cancellation include:
      <ul>
        <li>In-Person meetings with a club manager</li>
        <li>Emailing a specific address and including detailed information.</li>
        <li>Cancellations are often only allowed if moving a significant distance away or due to medical reasons.</li>
      </ul>
      These practices have led to legal actions. In May 2025, Equinox agreed to pay $600,000 in penalties and offer refunds after the New York Attorney General found that the company made it challenging for customers to cancel their memberships. The investigation revealed that Equinox failed to clearly disclose subscription terms and provided cumbersome cancellation procedures.

      <h2>Example 3: Misleading Headline</h2>
      <p><strong>Type:</strong> Misinformation</p>
      <p><strong>Who benefits:</strong> The publisher (they get more clicks and ads)</p>
      <p>Description: An article headline makes a big claim that isnâ€™t true, but people click because it sounds exciting.</p>
